# Mario Game 
The main goal of this project was to get a better sense of Javascript HTML CSS and begin learning Kaboom.js as this library came highly recommended. 

Kaboom.js is a library that allowed me to use a lot of thier built-in functions.Creating scenes, adding layers, creating sprites, dealing with actions, collisions, adding key events. I enjoyed  geting into the world of game development by using Kaboom.js there is a learning curve but the documentation is solid.

 ## Takeaways
 This project gave me a new avenue to explore with javascript kabbom.js is really great for getting started in 2D and even 3D. Mario is an alltime classic game from my childhood. So that made fighting the bugs less painfull and worth it. 
 
 
 ## Improvements
I did not commit often on this project kept thinking I could do it without running into too many problems... That was Wrong.\
The player can fall of the edges and mario will die So have to fix that.\
Mario lacks a jumpling sprite and running animation. 
Evil-Mushrooms keep walking and floating along even after they have no ground to walk on.


## Final Thoughts
After you play the game please let me know if there are any bugs you found that need to be fixed.
