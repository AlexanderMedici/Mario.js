## Description

This computer game is a nostalgic throwback of the 1980's classic Mario. The static website integrates server-side rendering to serve pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Mario takes advantage of Kabbomjs built-in library functions which simplify game development for 2D or even 3D game assets.  Camera positioning, collisions, movement, and in-game power-ups are all made available in this game and integrate smoothly. 

<BR/>

## Use Case
This project is more specialized as a homebrew game targeted for nostalgic millennials or younger children who enjoy the simplicity of retro 1980's to early 1990's themed games. Integrating Kaboom library into built-in browser games allows for flexibility and customization. As such, this game could be customized and used to entertain at functions, or parties.

## Getting Started

In the project you can run:

### ` "Spacebar" : "Jump"`,

Mario can jump to avoid mushrooms or he can jump on top of them to defeat them. Beware if they collide with Mario he will lose. 

### `"Left": "Moves Mario Left"`,
Moves Mario left as he attempts to collect in-game items. 


### `"Right": "Moves Mario Right"`,

Moves Mario right as he implements a tactical retreat as a mushroom can surprise you.
