## Features

Mario There and Back Again is a standalone static page online game. Collisions, sprites, a scoring system. You take on the character from an absolute classic game Mario. Fight Evil Mushrooms, gather coins and explore new and challenging levels. A static website uses server-side rendering to serve pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web browser, in contrast to traditional dynamic sites that work by rendering the webpage at the time of the request.

## Description
Mario takes advantage of Kabbomjs built-in library functions which simplify game development for 2D or even 3D game assets. The documentation provided is helpful. Camera positioning, collisions, movement, in-game power-ups are made available and work wonderfully. Unity and Unreal game engine are the gold standards for game devs. Kaboom is very close to having a real impact in nostalgic games and homebrew custom games.

## Use Case
This project is more specialized as homebrew games have a demographic especially if you played that game as a child now you can edit modify the game. Mario is a classic game and all the bugs and research time spent on its creation were well worth it. Kaboom is perfect for entry into game development building browser games helps to learn fundamental principles before more complex game development.
