# Mario Game 
The main goal of this project was to use javascript in a way that is a bit unconventional as javascript is inteneded to give interactivity to a webpage, game logic is a lot more dense and involves a lot more moving parts. 
Adding to its complexity learning a library such as kaboom.js.

Kaboom.js is a JavaScript library that was used to  make  this game.This library allowed me to create scenes, add layers, create sprites, deal with actions and collisions, adding key events.
I enjoyed  geting into the world of game development by using Kaboom.js there is a learning curve but the documentation is solid.

 ## Takeaways
 This project gave me a new avenue to explore with javascript kabbom.js is really great for getting started in 2D and even 3D. Mario is an alltime classic game from my childhood. So that made fighting the bugs less painfull and worth it. 
 
 
 ## Improvements
I did not commit often on this project kept thinking I could do it without running into too many problems... That was Wrong. 
The player can fall of the edges and mario will die So have to fix that.
Mario lacks a jumpling sprite and running animation.
